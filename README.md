# Face Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting human faces in images using computer vision techniques. The project utilizes OpenCV, a popular library for computer vision tasks, to implement face detection.

## Features
- Face detection in images
- Real-time face detection speacially trained on webcam face images
- Ability to draw bounding boxes around detected faces
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Technologies Used
- OpenCV
- Python

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd face-detection
```
3. Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Detecting Faces in Images
1. Place the images you want to analyze in the `images` directory.
2. And run
   ```
   api/st_api.ipynb
   ```

3. The program will display the images with bounding boxes around detected faces.
